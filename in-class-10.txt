4. A gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ___ignore_____ in a project,
we will need git to ignore our .env file
5. The PDO query method takes as an argument a sql query and returns the results back
as a PDO ___statement______ object which we can then get data out of.
6. From the PDO statement object we use the __fetch______ method to return a single row of
the SQL result set.
7. From the PDO statement object we use the __fetchAll______ method to return all rows of the
SQL result set.
8. A _prepared statement_______ is a parameterized and reusable SQL query which forces the developer to
write the SQL command and the user-provided data separately.
9. We call the prepare method with a sql query with any dynamic parameters subbed in
with names prefixed with _a colon______.
