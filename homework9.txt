Homework 9


1. SQL is a language used to manage and manipulate databases, while MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL. Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns, structured to define relationships using keys.

2. Normalization is the process of organizing database tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing them into smaller tables and defining relationships.

3. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, while a foreign key links one table to another by referencing the primary key of the related table.

4. The three types are One-to-One (one record in each table is related), One-to-Many (one record in one table relates to multiple records in another), and Many-to-Many (records in one table relate to multiple records in another through an intermediary table).

5. An inner join returns only matching rows from both tables, while a left join returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, with NULL for unmatched rows.
