1. PDO (PHP Data Objects) is a database access layer providing a uniform method for interacting with databases. 
A DSN (Data Source Name) specifies the connection details such as host, database name and charset for PDO to connect to a database.

2. A .env file stores environment variables such as credentials or configuration settings, keeping sensitive data separate from the codebase. 
A .gitignore file specifies files or directories Git should ignore, preventing them from being committed to the repository.

3. Passwords should never be uploaded to GitHub to avoid exposing sensitive information, which can lead to security breaches.

4. SQL injection is a security vulnerability where malicious SQL code is injected into a query to manipulate or access a database unauthorizedly.

5. Prepared statements are a database feature that allows SQL queries to be precompiled and safely executed with user-supplied data. Variables can be passed using placeholders (e.g., ? or :name) and bound with methods like bindParam() or execute().

6.C: CREATE TABLE posts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
